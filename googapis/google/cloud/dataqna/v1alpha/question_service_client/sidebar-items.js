initSidebarItems({"struct":[["QuestionServiceClient","Service to interpret natural language queries. The service allows to create `Question` resources that are interpreted and are filled with one or more interpretations if the question could be interpreted. Once a `Question` resource is created and has at least one interpretation, an interpretation can be chosen for execution, which triggers a query to the backend (for BigQuery, it will create a job). Upon successful execution of that interpretation, backend specific information will be returned so that the client can retrieve the results from the backend."]]});
