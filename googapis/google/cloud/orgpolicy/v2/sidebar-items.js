For example, you could enforce a constraint that controls which cloud services can be activated across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can have serial port connections established. `Constraints` can be configured by the organization’s policy adminstrator to fit the needs of the organzation by setting a `policy` that includes `constraints` at different locations in the organization’s resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the resource hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden.
