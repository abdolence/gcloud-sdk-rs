Choose this based on two considerations: A) Do you expect your measurements to monotonically improve? If so, choose LAST_MEASUREMENT. On the other hand, if you’re in a situation where your system can “over-train” and you expect the performance to get better for a while but then start declining, choose BEST_MEASUREMENT. B) Are your measurements significantly noisy and/or irreproducible? If so, BEST_MEASUREMENT will tend to be over-optimistic, and it may be better to choose LAST_MEASUREMENT.
