initSidebarItems({"enum":[["ScaleTier","A scale tier is an abstract representation of the resources Cloud ML will allocate to a training job. When selecting a scale tier for your training job, you should consider the size of your training dataset and the complexity of your model. As the tiers increase, virtual machines are added to handle your job, and the individual machines in the cluster generally have more memory and greater processing power than they do at lower tiers. The number of training units charged per hour of processing increases as tiers get more advanced. Refer to the pricing guide for more details. Note that in addition to incurring costs, your use of training resources is constrained by the quota policy."]]});
